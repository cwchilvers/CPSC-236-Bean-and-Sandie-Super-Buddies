## Description
This project was developed for the Visual Programming class (CPSC-236) at Chapman University. The goal was to use the skills we acquired in class to create a 2D game using Unity. The main concept of the game was developed by Olivia Chilvers. Game mecahnics, such as changing weather conditions, were proposed by Ritu Venkatsubramani. Programming, sprites, tiles, UI, 8-bit SFX, and 8-bit remixes of popular songs were done by Chandler Chilvers.
